# Road-Accident-Case-Study.
Here is my first project entailed using Microsoft Excel to create an interactive dashboard that analyzed and summarized data for a road accident, which was just recently finished.

TO COMPARE THE ROAD ACCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED IN 2021 AND 2022

> Requirements:

1.Make a dashboard for road accidents for the years 2021 and 2022.
2.Show the total number of casualties.
3.Total fatalities and their percentages according to accident severity,
4.Casualties per type of vehicle
5.Comparison of the monthly trends in casualties for 2021 & 2022
6.Maximum casualties by type of road
7.Total casualty distribution by road surface relationship between casualties by area, location, and day/night

♻ Analysis of the Dataset:
✔ Cleaning of Data
✔Processing of Data
✔Analysis of Data
✔Dashboard for data visualization

> Outcomes:
1. 417883 total casualties
2. Slight casualties have the highest accident record rate,
with the majority of accidents occurring in urban areas.
3.The proportion of car accident casualties that occur during the day as
compared to at night, when it is at its highest.
4.The majority of accidents occur on single-carriageway roads.
5.When compared to other types of roads, dry surface roads experience the highest number of accidents.

Using KPIs, line chart, slicers, donut chart , bar chart etc
